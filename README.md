## 🌟 The Problem

**A $20 barrier blocks millions of talented Latin Americans from accessing essential tools.**

- 💰 **Financial Barrier**: $20 USD represents a significant investment in Latin American economies
- 🧠 **Talent Without Tools**: Brilliant people with innovative ideas can't access ChatGPT Plus, Canva Pro, or productivity tools
- 🔗 **Opportunity Gap**: Investors wanting to support emerging talent lack a structured, trustworthy channel

## 💡 Our Solution

Primer Impulso creates a new model for early talent discovery by enabling micro-sponsorships:

### For Entrepreneurs 👩‍💻
- **Free SaaS Access**: ChatGPT Plus, Canva Pro, and other essential tools
- **Mentorship**: Direct connection with successful entrepreneurs
- **Future Capital**: Pipeline to larger funding rounds as you grow

### For Sponsors 💼
- **Small Investment, Big Impact**: $30/month to support 1-3 entrepreneurs
- **Early Access**: First look at emerging Latin American talent
- **Curated Pipeline**: Pre-vetted entrepreneurs with validated potential

### For the Ecosystem 🌍
- **Democratized Access**: Remove geographical and economic barriers
- **More Successful Startups**: Enable more entrepreneurs to launch and scale
- **Inclusive Investment**: New model for discovering and supporting talent

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

- **Platform**: Base44 (No-code development platform)
- **AI Tools**: Claude AI for concept development, ChatGPT for product logic
- **Features**: 
  - Entrepreneur profiles and application tracking
  - Sponsor matching system
  - Progress monitoring dashboard
  - SaaS provider API integrations (planned)

## 📊 Market Opportunity

- **8M+** potential entrepreneurs in Bogotá alone
- **$20** barrier that blocks talent access
- **30-50%** bulk SaaS discounts we can negotiate
- **$60K** estimated MRR with 1K active sponsorships

## 💰 Business Model

```
Sponsor Payment: $30/month per entrepreneur
├── SaaS Tools: $25 (negotiated bulk rates)
└── Platform Fee: $5 (our revenue)

Revenue Streams:
├── Platform fees: $5 per active sponsorship
├── Bulk SaaS margins: 30-50% discounts
└── Placement fees: Standard fees for graduates raising larger rounds
```

**Conservative Projection**: 1,000 active sponsorships = $60K MRR + placement fees

## 🌟 Why This Matters

**Personal Story**: Living in Roldanillo, Colombia, I've witnessed firsthand how the $20 barrier stops brilliant people from accessing tools that could transform their ideas into reality. This isn't just about SaaS access—it's about unlocking human potential.

**The Insight**: Many successful entrepreneurs and diaspora members want to give back and support emerging talent, but lack a structured, trustworthy way to do it. Primer Impulso bridges this gap.
